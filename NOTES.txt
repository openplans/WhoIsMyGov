CODE NOTES
=============


the controller in controllers/people.py are actually centered around
districts, because that's what the models are:


 * District

   each district has an arbitrary number of key: val pairs which are
   stored as DistrictsMeta instances (in the districts_meta table)

 * DistrictsMeta are in apparently arbitrary order - presumably by id
   (and thus by order of insertion)

 * people are just DistrictsMeta instances, by convention with
   "official" as the key



thoughts:

 - I could just have "candidate" as another key convention.  but there
   are multiple candidates per district so there'd be no way to relate
   data to specific candidates.

 - really should refactor the data to have people as first-class
   objects, and a people_meta table instead.
